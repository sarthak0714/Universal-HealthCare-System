# The Idea
We do not carry our Health reports everywhere so we need to 
find a solution for this issue.
* It will have a patient interface and a Doctor interface which can be accessed through the login types.
* Patient will be able to update their personal information and view reports and ongoing medications.
* Doctors will be able to update/view/modify these records.
* Everything will be in one program which will support images of previous reports and also their digital reports like X-ray.
* During emergency Doctors can access patient information through UHS using the patients Phone number.
* It will be universal system and can be accessed in every Hospital/clinic which currently is a issue
